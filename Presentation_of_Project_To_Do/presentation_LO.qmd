## Syllabus - Project (groups composition due 16 Oct)

- Credit risk case study. 

- Part A: Using real life data sources, a set of tasks to perform in group (9, 16, 23 Oct, a short report tracking current code/analysis due for next week class):
    - Defining the problem / Building the data set [Getting /Cleansing/Enriching Data] / Exploration / Baseline model
    - Implementing ideas from academic literature on credit risk (feature engineering) / (Model evaluation pipeline with tidymodels)
    - Advanced topics: "applied" gradient boosting, model (re)calibration, PDP/SHAP

## Syllabus - Project

- Part B: In parallel a selection of topics will be proposed to the students with the goal to assess alternative methods (projects choice due 23 Oct): 
    - the reading of selected papers,
    -	the understanding of the methods or algorithms at stake (if necessary the students will re-implement from scratch a simplified version, develop intuition on toy data sets, give short proofs / overview of key results),
    -	the implementation of the methods on the real life data set,
    -	the assessment of the method,
    -	the writing of a final report summarizing/finalizing part A / implementing part B (intermediary discussion 6 Nov, final project reports due 17 Nov 23:59).

- Part C: A final presentation (group/one-to-one meeting, 20 Nov).


## The exam
### A simplified / anonymized data set

Bankruptcy prediction data set related to public US companies spanning 1987-2015.

Testing set spanning 2016-2019.

Simplified, cleansed, non-default event undersampled.

## Today
### Build your own data set

- Build you own data set from scratch

- Make assumptions

- Check data quality, especially the event of interest: the default

- Build your own data set from scratch


## The data at hand {.scrollable}

In principle, most bankruptcies ([Chapter 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code)/ [Chapter 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code)) in the U.S. between 1960 and 2023 for publicly listed companies.

In practice, many bankruptcies are lacking, other default events (payment default, distressed debt) non tracked.

Predictors:

-   Firm accounting data from Compustat (S&P). For US and Canadian companies, annual history is available back to 1950 and quarterly as well as monthly histories date back to 1962.

-   US stocks data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).

-   Both sources (Compustat/CRSP) available through the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). Possible to link Compustat/CRSP. 
WRDS is one of the most widely used source for asset and financial data used in academic setting. Subscribed by UT Capitole.

## WRDS {.scrollable}

For access to the data, register with your `ut-capitole` email. Go to this url: <https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/register/>

## WRDS {.scrollable}

It takes roughly a week to be validated by `ut-capitole` teams.

## WRDS with R {.scrollable}

https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/wrds-crsp-and-compustat.html

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
library(dbplyr)
library(RPostgres)
# First create two environment variables to connect wrds
# in a terminal: touch $HOME/.Renviron
# inside the .Renviron file
# wrds_user = your_user
# wrds_password = your_password

wrds <- dbConnect(
    Postgres(),
    host = "wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu",
    dbname = "wrds",
    port = 9737,
    sslmode = "require",
    user = Sys.getenv("wrds_user"),
    password = Sys.getenv("wrds_password")
)

compustat_list <- dbListObjects(wrds, Id(schema = "comp"))

# Use dplyr verbs with a remote database table
# https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl.src_dbi.html
funda_db <- tbl(wrds, in_schema("comp", "funda"))
funda_db %>%
  filter(grepl('APPLE INC', conm)) %>%
  select(gvkey, fyear, conm, at, wcap, re, ebit, lt, sale) %>%
  mutate(WCTA = wcap / at,
         RETA = re / at,
         EBTA = ebit / at,
         TLTA  = lt / at, # as a proxy for ME/TL
         SLTA = sale / at)
```

## Default definition - Bank for International Settlements (BIS) {.scrollable}

In order to estimate a dynamic logit model, we need an indicator of financial distress / default and a set of predictors.

![](images/default_definition_BIS.png)

The indicator equals one in a month in which a firm filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 or Chapter 11, and zero otherwise; in particular, the indicator is zero if the firm disappears from the data set for some reason other than bankruptcy such as acquisition or delisting.
